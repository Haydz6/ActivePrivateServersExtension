# ActivePrivateServersExtension
## This has become broken with roblox updates, I now have a roblox extension that has this feature implemented called RoQoL

Allows you to see which private servers are actively billing you

Download the project as a zip and extract it under a folder.
Open your extensions and turn on developer console.
Click load unpacked and select the folder you extracted the zip to.

If you did it correctly: go to your inventory, hover over Private Servers and there should be a Active Private Servers button.
